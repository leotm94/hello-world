## Testing, that's kind of new, but let's go. üê£
### My name is Leonardo,
I'm 27 years old and I'm from Brazil. I can speak brazilian portuguese, english and french, and I can understand some spanish despite not being able to speak it. I've just started learning how to code (HTML, CSS and JS) in university [^1]. I face it as the process of learning another language, with syntax, grammar and vocabulary. In the beggining, we speak as toddlers, but keep on practicing and in no time, your first html page is ready, then a calculator, an app, the navigation system for an interstellar spaceship...
